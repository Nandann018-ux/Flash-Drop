# FlashDrop – Limited-Time Flash Sale E-Commerce Platform

## 1. Project Overview

**FlashDrop** is a flash-sale-based e-commerce platform where products are available **only for a limited time window** and in **limited stock**.

Once the sale time expires or stock runs out, the product becomes unavailable for purchase.

The project focuses on implementing **real-world e-commerce business logic** such as time-based availability, stock consistency, and order validation.

This project is designed to demonstrate full-stack development skills with emphasis on backend logic and API design.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional e-commerce platforms allow products to be available indefinitely, which reduces urgency and does not reflect real-world flash sale scenarios.

Handling flash sales introduces challenges such as:
- Time-based product visibility
- Preventing purchases after sale expiry
- Avoiding overselling during high demand

FlashDrop solves these problems by enforcing strict **time-bound access** and **atomic stock handling** at the backend level.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 User Roles

- **Admin**
  - Creates and manages flash sale products
- **User**
  - Browses products
  - Places orders during active sale windows

---

### 3.2 Flash Sale Products

Each product includes:
- Name and description
- Price
- Limited stock
- Sale start time
- Sale end time
- Active status

**Business Rules**
- Products are visible only during the sale window
- Orders are blocked if:
  - Sale has expired
  - Stock is exhausted

---

### 3.3 Order Management

- Users can place orders only for active products
- Stock is reduced inside a database transaction
- Prevents race conditions and overselling

---

### 3.4 Auto Expiry System

- Background job automatically marks products inactive after sale end time
- Ensures expired products cannot be purchased even if frontend fails

---

## 4. Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Prisma ORM
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API architecture

### Frontend

- Frontend: Vercel

---

## 5. Database Design

### User Model
- id
- email
- password
- role (ADMIN / USER)

### Product Model
- id
- name
- description
- price
- stock
- saleStartTime
- saleEndTime
- isActive

### Order Model

## 6. API Design

### Product APIs
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| POST | /api/products | Create flash sale product |
| GET | /api/products | Get active products |
| GET | /api/products/:id | Get product details |
| PUT | /api/products/:id | Update product |
| DELETE | /api/products/:id | Delete product |

### Order APIs
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| POST | /api/orders | Place an order |
| GET | /api/orders | Get user orders |

## 7. Learning Outcomes

- Implemented time-based business logic at API level
- Handled stock consistency using database transactions
- Designed RESTful APIs with proper validation
- Managed role-based access control
- Deployed full-stack application to production

---

## 8. Future Improvements

- Payment gateway integration
- Admin analytics dashboard
- Product categories
- Rate limiting for high traffic scenarios

---

## 9. Conclusion

FlashDrop is a practical full-stack project that simulates real-world flash sale e-commerce systems and demonstrates strong backend problem-solving skills suitable for full-stack developer interviews.
